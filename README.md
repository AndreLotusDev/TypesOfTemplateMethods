## Introduction
The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Purpose of the Template Method Pattern
This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple algorithms or workflows share a similar series of steps but have different implementations of some of these steps. It promotes reusability and extension while adhering to the principle of "Inversion of Control" - the base class controls the algorithm, and the subclasses provide the specific details.

## Example of Usage
Imagine a software for generating reports where the steps for data collection and rendering are fixed, but the content and format of the report can vary. The Template Method pattern allows different types of reports to share a common algorithm for report generation with customizable content and format.

## Code Example in C#
```csharp
public abstract class ReportGenerator
{
    // The template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
    public void GenerateReport()
    {
        CollectData();
        AnalyzeData();
        RenderReport();
    }

    protected abstract void CollectData();
    protected abstract void AnalyzeData();

    // Default implementation of rendering (can be overridden)
    protected virtual void RenderReport()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering report in a standard format");
    }
}

public class FinancialReportGenerator : ReportGenerator
{
    protected override void CollectData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Collecting financial data");
    }

    protected override void AnalyzeData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Analyzing financial data");
    }

    protected override void RenderReport()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Rendering financial report in a specific format");
    }
}
```
